# Budget Tracker Starter Code

## Description
Budget Tracker demonstrates the use of service worker and IndexedDB to show that a user may enter data
while the application is offline. This App keeps track of expenses entered by the user. When it so happens that
the internet connection is very poor or goes offline, the user may still use the app to enter expenses. The 
files needed for the app to function are stored in the local cache. When the connection is restored, all entries
made are automatically saved, and the user is notified that the data entered while offline has been added.
